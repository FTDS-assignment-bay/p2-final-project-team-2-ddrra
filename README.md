## Role in the Project
As a Data Scientist, my responsibilities included:

- Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer sentiment distribution.
- Preprocessing and transforming text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
- Building and optimizing a Deep Learning model using TensorFlow for sentiment prediction.
- Evaluating model performance and fine-tuning hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- Providing actionable insights for McDonald's management to enhance customer experience. 

## Background
In the fast-food industry, customer satisfaction plays a crucial role in business growth. Understanding customer feedback allows McDonald's to:

- Identify trends in customer satisfaction and service quality.
- Assess restaurant performance across different locations.
- Improve product offerings based on real-time customer insights.
- Make data-driven decisions instead of relying on assumptions.

## Project Objectives
‚úÖ Develop a sentiment analysis model to classify customer reviews. <br>
‚úÖ Identify key factors influencing positive and negative feedback. <br>
‚úÖ Provide McDonald's with data-driven insights to improve customer experience. <br>
‚úÖ Automate the sentiment analysis process for real-time monitoring.

## Model Performance Summary
- Test Accuracy: 87%
- Test Loss: 0.32
- Classification Report:
   + Negative Sentiment: Precision (85%), Recall (88%), F1-Score (86%)
   + Neutral Sentiment: Precision (83%), Recall (84%), F1-Score (83%)
   + Positive Sentiment: Precision (90%), Recall (88%), F1-Score (89%)
- Confusion Matrix Analysis:
   + The model struggles slightly in distinguishing Negative & Neutral Sentiments.
   + Positive Sentiment predictions are the most accurate.
- Training & Validation Trends:
   + Accuracy improves steadily over epochs, indicating good learning.
   + Loss decreases consistently, showing minimal overfitting.

## Conclusion
‚úÖ The model performs well with an accuracy of 87%, making it suitable for customer sentiment analysis at McDonald's. <br>
‚úÖ Predictions are stable, but improvements can be made in differentiating Neutral & Negative Sentiments. <br>
‚úÖ This model can be used by McDonald's management to analyze customer satisfaction trends and optimize their services.
